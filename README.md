# Quantum Information Theory

This repository contains annotations, notes, and small projects developed during my studies in **Quantum Information Theory** and **Quantum Computing**.  
The material combines theoretical foundations with practical implementations, primarily using **Python** and **Qiskit**.

## Contents

- **Notes & Annotations**
  - Core concepts in quantum information theory
  - Mathematical foundations (states, measurements, entanglement, circuits)
  - Explanatory notebooks and derivations

- **Jupyter Notebooks**
  - `qiskit-lesson1.ipynb` — Introductory Qiskit concepts and basic quantum circuits
  - `somador10qbits.ipynb` — Quantum adder implementation using multi-qubit registers

- **Small Projects**
  - Quantum algorithms and subroutines
  - Circuit constructions and simulations
  - Exploratory implementations related to quantum arithmetic and information processing

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Qiskit
- Linear Algebra & Quantum Mechanics formalism

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Serve as a structured study log
- Consolidate theoretical understanding with hands-on experimentation
- Provide reproducible examples for learning and reference

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **educational and research purposes**.  
Implementations may prioritize clarity and learning over performance or optimization.
